# Short description of the game
Pengo is an arcade game developed by Coreland and published by Sega in Japan on September 26, 1982.

In this video game, the player controls Pengo, a penguin trapped in a maze made out of ice blocks with multiple enemies known as Sno-Bees.
The player’s main objective is to survive each round by eliminating all the Sno-Bees and their eggs; this can be done by sliding the ice blocks and crushing the enemies with them.

# How to play the game, detailing the controls
To play the game, the player has to use the arrow keys to move the character (Pengo). If the player presses the arrow key at any direction and on that direction there is an ice block, there can be 2 consequences: pushing the block since the block meets another one or, if there is another block facing the one you are trying to push, the first one is going to break.

The goal of the game is to destroy all the Sno-Bees by pushing ice blocks to squash them. If Pengo touches a Sno-Bee, the player loses one life. The game ends when all the lives are lost. Depending on how much time it took the player to pass the level, there will be some awards and bonus points.
